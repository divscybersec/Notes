### IAAA
IAAA is a simple way to think about how users and their actions are verified on applications. Each item plays a crucial role and it isn't possible to skip a level. That means, if a previous item isn't being performed, you cannot perform the later times. The four items are:

- **Identity** - the unique account (e.g., user ID/email) that represents a person or service.
- **Authentication** - proving that identity (passwords, OTP, passkeys).
- **Authorisation** - what that identity is allowed to do.
- **Accountability** - recording and alerting on who did what, when, and from where.

### Broken access control
Broken Access Control happens when the server doesn’t properly enforce **who can access what** on every request. A common occurence of this is **IDOR** (Insecure Direct Object Reference).

### Authentication failure
Authentication Failures happen when an application can’t reliably verify or bind a user’s identity. Common issues include:

- username enumeration
- weak/guessable passwords (no lockout/rate limits)
- logic flaws in the login/registration flow
- insecure session or cookie handling

### Security Misconfiguration

Security misconfigurations happen when systems, servers, or applications are deployed with unsafe defaults, incomplete settings, or exposed services. These are not code bugs but mistakes in how the environment, software, or network is set up. They create easy entry points for attackers.

Even small misconfigurations can expose sensitive data, enable privilege escalation, or give attackers a foothold into the system. Modern applications rely on complex stacks, cloud services, and third-party APIs. A single exposed admin panel, an open storage bucket, or misconfigured permissions can compromise the entire system.

**Common Patterns**

- Default credentials or weak passwords left unchanged
- Unnecessary services or endpoints exposed to the internet
- Misconfigured cloud storage or permissions (S3, Azure Blob, GCP buckets)
- Unrestricted API access or missing authentication/authorisation
- Verbose error messages exposing stack traces or system details
- Outdated software, frameworks, or containers with known vulnerabilities
- Exposed AI/ML endpoints without proper access controls

**How To Prevent It**

- Harden default configurations and remove unused features or services
- Enforce strong authentication and least privilege across all systems
- Limit network exposure and segment sensitive resources
- Keep software, frameworks, and containers up to date with patches
- Hide stack traces and system information from error messages
- Audit cloud configurations and permissions regularly
- Secure AI endpoints and automation services with proper access controls and monitoring
- Integrate configuration reviews and automated security checks into your deployment pipeline

### Software supply chain failures
Software supply chain failures happen when applications rely on components, libraries, services, or models that are compromised, outdated, or improperly verified. These weaknesses are not inherent in your code, but rather in the software and tools you depend on. Attackers exploit these weak links to inject malicious code, bypass security, or steal sensitive data.

**Why It Matters**  
Modern applications are built from many third-party packages, APIs, and AI models. One compromised dependency can compromise your entire system, allowing attackers to gain access without ever touching your own code. Supply chain attacks can be automated and distributed, making them hard to detect and very damaging.

**Common Patterns**

- Using unverified or unmaintained libraries and dependencies
- Automatically installing updates without verification
- Over-reliance on third-party AI models without monitoring or auditing
- Insecure build pipelines or CI/CD processes that allow tampering
- Poor license or provenance tracking for components
- Lack of monitoring for vulnerabilities in dependencies after deployment

**How To Protect The Supply Chain**

- Verify all third-party components, libraries, and AI models before use
- Monitor and patch dependencies regularly
- Sign, verify, and audit software updates and packages
- Lock down CI/CD pipelines and build processes to prevent tampering
- Track provenance and licensing for all dependencies
- Implement runtime monitoring for unusual behaviour from dependencies or AI components
- Integrate supply chain threat modelling into the SDLC, including testing, deployment, and update workflows

### Cryptographic failure
Cryptographic failures happen when encryption is used incorrectly or not at all. This includes weak algorithms, hard-coded keys, poor key handling, or unencrypted sensitive data. These flaws let attackers access information that should be private.

**Why It Matters**  
Web applications rely on cryptography everywhere: protecting network traffic, securing stored data, verifying identities, and safeguarding secrets. When these controls fail, sensitive data such as passwords, tokens, or personal information can be exposed, leading to account takeovers or full-scale breaches.

Attackers can exploit these flaws through man-in-the-middle attacks, brute-force attacks on weak keys, or by simply discovering secrets that were never properly protected.

**Common Patterns** 

- Using deprecated or weak algorithms like MD5, SHA-1, or ECB mode
- Hard-coded secrets in code or configuration
- Poor key rotation or management practices
- Lack of encryption for sensitive data at rest or in transit
- Self-signed or invalid TLS certificates
- Using AI/ML systems without proper secret handling for model parameters or sensitive inputs

**How To Prevent It**

- Use strong, modern algorithms such as AES-GCM, ChaCha20-Poly1305, or enforce TLS 1.3 with valid certificates
- Use secure key management services like Azure Key Vault, AWS KMS, or HashiCorp Vault
- Rotate secrets and keys regularly, following defined crypto periods
- Document and enforce policies and standard operating procedures for key lifecycle management
- Maintain a complete inventory of certificates, keys, and their owners
- Ensure AI models and automation agents never expose unencrypted secrets or sensitive data
- The web application in this room contains a weakness of this type for you to explore.

### Insecure Design
Insecure design happens when flawed logic or architecture is built into a system from the start. These flaws stem from skipped threat modelling, no design requirements or reviews, or accidental errors.
Moreover, with the introduction of AI assistants, AI systems exacerbate insecure design. Developers often assume that models are safe, correct, or predictable, or that the code they produce is flaw-free. When an AI system can generate queries, write code, or classify users without limits, the risk is built into the design, leading to poor architectural patterns.

**Why It Matters**  
You can't patch an insecure design. It's built into the workflow, logic, and trust boundaries. Fixing it means rethinking how systems, and now AI, make decisions.

**Common Insecure Designs In 2025**

- Weak business logic controls, like recovery or approval flows
- Flawed assumptions about user or model behaviour
- AI components with unchecked authority or access
- Missing guardrails for LLMs and automation agents
- Test or debug bypasses left in production
- No consistent abuse-case review or AI threat modelling

**Insecure Design In The AI Era**

AI introduces new kinds of design failures. For example, prompt injection occurs when user input is blended with system prompts, allowing attackers to hijack the context or extract hidden data. Blind trust in model output creates fragile systems that act on AI decisions without validation or oversight, which is why human review remains necessary. When it comes to poisoned models, pulled from unverified sources or fine-tuned on unsafe data, they can embed hidden behaviours or backdoors that compromise the system from within.

**How To Design Securely**

- Treat every model as untrusted until proven otherwise.
- Validate and filter all model inputs and outputs to ensure accuracy and integrity.
- Separate system prompts from user content.
- Keep sensitive data out of prompts unless absolutely needed and protect it with strict controls.
- Require human review for high-risk AI actions.
- Log model provenance, monitor behaviour, and apply differential privacy for sensitive data.
- Include AI-specific threat modelling for prompt attacks, inference risks, agent misuse, and supply chain compromise throughout the design process.
- Build threat modelling into every stage of development, not just at the start.
- Define clear security requirements for each feature before implementation.
- Apply the principle of least privilege across users, APIs, and services.
- Ensure proper authentication, authorisation, and session management across the system.
- Keep dependencies, third-party components, and supply chain sources verified and up to date.
- Continuously monitor and test the system for logic flaws, abuse paths, and emergent risks as new features or AI components are added.

### Injection

Injection occurs when an application takes user input and mishandles it. Instead of processing the input securely, the application passes it directly into a system that can execute commands or queries, such as a database, a shell, a templating engine or API.

The following are some classic examples of injection that you may be familiar with:

- SQL Injection
- Command Injection
- AI Prompts
- Server Side Template Injection (SSTI)

Preventing injection starts by ensuring that user input is always treated as untrusted. Rather than parsing directly, instead, take elements of the input for querying. For SQL queries, this means using prepared statements and parameterised queries instead of building queries through string concatenation. For OS commands, avoid functions that pass input directly to the system shell, and instead rely on safe APIs and processes that don’t invoke the shell at all.

Input validation and sanitisation play a crucial role in preventing these types of attack. Escape dangerous characters, enforce strict data types and filter before the application even processes the input.

### Software or Data integrity failure
Software or Data Integrity Failures occur when an application relies on code, updates, or data it assumes are safe, without verifying their authenticity, integrity, or origin. This includes trusting software updates without verification, loading scripts or configuration files from untrusted sources, failing to validate data that impacts application logic, or accepting data such as binaries, templates, or JSON files without confirming whether it has been altered.

**How to Avoid Software & Data Integrity Failures**

Preventing these failures begins with establishing trust boundaries. Applications should never assume that code, updates, or key pieces of data are legitimate and automatically trusted; their integrity must be verified. This involves using methods such as cryptographic checks (like checksums) for update packages and ensuring that only trusted sources can modify critical artefacts.
